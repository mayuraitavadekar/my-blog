Hi there! <br>
This is long time. Almost three months ago I wrote article over here. So I'm back. <br>

#### short story: <br>

I was preparing for an coding interview. It was my first coding interview and I had revised all the concepts
of DS&ALGO. But I wasn't hands on. Interviewer asked me to explain the concepts in quiksort and I explained.
But when he asked to open the code editor and write down the code. I coudldn't. Why? I wasn't 100% sure that
I know the concept of quicksort. I failed. Here is small try to explain what is quicksort and how can you
implement it. Go ahead!!

#### the concept: <br>

In quicksort, we take an element and place it in such position where all the elements on it's left hand side
are smaller than that element and all the elements on right hand side are greater than that element. So each element
find it's own place where it is in sorted position.
isn't it simple? No? Wait. Let me explain how we do that.

Let's take an array A

```
    0   1   2   3    4   5   6   7   8
    10  16  8   12  15   6   3   9   5
```

Now, let's select pivot and put low and high as limiters.

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3    4   5   6   7   8
    10  16  8   12  15   6   3   9   5
    ↑
    pivot
```

We've selected first element as pivot. Now let's put variables i at low and j at high in the first iteration.

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3    4   5   6   7   8
    10  16  8   12  15   6   3   9   5
    ↑                                ↑
    pivot                            j
    i
```

pivot=10 means, we want to place the pivot=10 in correct position where all the elements to the left
are smaller than pivot=10 and all the elements on the right side are greater than pivot=10.
In other words, when you find an element greater than 10, you will send it to right side. And when you
find an element less than 10 you will bring it to the right hand side.

Increament i until you find an element greater than pivot=10.

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3   4    5   6   7   8
    10  16  8   12  15   6   3   9   5
    ↑   ↑                            ↑
pivot   i                            j

```

Decrement j until you find element smaller than pivot=10

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3    4   5   6   7   8
    10  16  8   12  15   6   3   9   5
    ↑   ↑                            ↑
pivot   i                            j

```

Interchange arr(i) and arr(j).

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3   4    5   6   7   8
    10  5   8   12  15   6   3   9   16
    ↑   ↑                            ↑
pivot   i                            j

```

Again, Increament i until you find an element greater than pivot=10 and decrement j until you find element smaller than pivot=10.

```
    low                              high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3    4   5   6   7   8
    10  5   8   12  15   6   3   9   16
    ↑           ↑                ↑
pivot           i                j

```

Interchange arr(i) and arr(j).

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3    4   5   6   7   8
    10  5   8   9   15   6   3   12  16
    ↑           ↑                ↑
pivot           i                j

```

Again, Increament i until you find an element greater than pivot=10 and decrement j until you find element smaller than pivot=10.

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3    4   5   6   7   8
    10  5   8   9   15   6   3   12  16
    ↑               ↑        ↑
pivot               i        j

```

Interchange arr(i) and arr(j).

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3   4   5    6   7   8
    10  5   8   9   3   6   15   12  16
    ↑               ↑        ↑
pivot               i        j

```

Again, Increament i until you find an element greater than pivot=10 and decrement j until you find element smaller than pivot=10.

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3   4   5    6   7   8
    10  5   8   9   3   6   15   12  16
    ↑                   ↑    ↑
pivot                   j    i

```

Here i>j, stop! don't interchange. See the position of j, this is where you need to place pivot=10 element.
Interchange arr(pivot) and arr(j).

```
    low                             high
    ↓                                ↓
    0   1   2   3   4   5    6   7   8
    6   5   8   9   3   10   15   12  16
    ↑                   ↑    ↑
pivot                   j    i

```

Notice, 10 is at correct position where all the elements on the left on 10 are smaller and all the elements
on the right side are greater than 10. So need to displace 10 now. Now next time, we sort left hand side of 10 and
right hand side of 10 recursively. <br>
Similar algorithm we will apply on the left hand side and right hand side recursively. Each time pivot will be
placed in correct position.

```
    low            high     low      high
    ↓               ↓        ↓        ↓
    0   1   2   3   4   5    6    7   8
    6   5   8   9   3   10   15   12  16
    ↑               ↑        ↑        ↑
pivot,i             j      pivot,i    j

```

#### coding quicksort: <br>

Let's write some code step by step. First let's write a driver code.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#define max 100

int main()
{

    int arr[max], n;

    cout << "enter how many elements : " << endl;
    cin >> n;

    cout << "enter elements one by one : " << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }

    quicksort(arr, 0, n - 1);

    cout << "finally sorted array is : " << endl;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }

    cout << endl;
}
```

Now, let's write <i>quicksort()<i> function. But, step by step ;)

```
int quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    // write some code here.
}

```

Declare pivot, i, j and temp(for interchanging/swapping). put pivot at first position/low, i on low and j on high.

```
int quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    int pivot, temp, i, j;

    pivot = low;
    i = low;
    j = high;
}

```

increment i until it finds element greater than pivot element. <br>
decrement j until it finds element smaller than pivot element. <br>

```
int quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    int pivot, temp, i, j;

    pivot = low;
    i = low;
    j = high;

    while (arr[i] <= arr[pivot])
    {
        i++;
    }

    while (arr[j] > arr[pivot])
    {
        j--;
    }
}

```

Now, once both incremented/decremented at corrent position and still <i>i<j</i>, interchange arr(i) and arr(j).<br>

```
int quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    int pivot, temp, i, j;

    pivot = low;
    i = low;
    j = high;

    while (arr[i] <= arr[pivot])
    {
        i++;
    }

    while (arr[j] > arr[pivot])
    {
        j--;
    }

    if (i < j)
    {
        temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}

```

Now, we need to repeat the whole steps until i<j. Hence put everything inside while loop.

```
int quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    int pivot, temp, i, j;

    pivot = low;
    i = low;
    j = high;

    while(i<j) {
        while (arr[i] <= arr[pivot])
        {
            i++;
        }

        while (arr[j] > arr[pivot])
        {
            j--;
        }

        if (i < j)
        {
            temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
        }
    }

}
```

Now when i>j, that means we've found correct position (j index) where we can place pivot element. Hence interchange
arr(pivot) and arr(j).

```
int quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    int pivot, temp, i, j;

    pivot = low;
    i = low;
    j = high;

    while(i<j) {
        while (arr[i] <= arr[pivot])
        {
            i++;
        }

        while (arr[j] > arr[pivot])
        {
            j--;
        }

        if (i < j)
        {
            temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
        }
    }

    temp = arr[pivot];
    arr[pivot] = arr[j];
    arr[j] = temp;
}
```

Now, pivot element has been placed at correct position, now we need to sort left side and right side
seperately, recursively. For that we need to call <i>quicksort()</i> recursively.

```
int quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    int i, j, pivot, temp;

    if (low < high)
    {
        pivot = low;
        i = low;
        j = high;

        while (i < j)
        {
            while (arr[i] <= arr[pivot])
            {
                i++;
            }

            while (arr[j] > arr[pivot])
            {
                j--;
            }

            if (i < j)
            {
                temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
            }
        }

        temp = arr[pivot];
        arr[pivot] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;

        quicksort(arr, low, j - 1);
        quicksort(arr, j + 1, high);
    }
}
```

That's all. Now you can run the code. In the main function, you are printing the sorted array. The code is complete.
Wohoooo!!!
