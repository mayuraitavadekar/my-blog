In this article, I am going to write my personal experiences with JS. Since the last 2 years,
I am writing nearly everything - the front-end, the back-end - in JS. I personally written thousands of lines of code
in my personal projects as well as my in my job. So there are some experiences good and bad which I want to write here.

<br />

#### <u>JavaScript as language</u>

<br />

The language rapidly grew.
Today, JavaScript is one of the fastest evolving languages in CS. ECMA is adding new features constantly. So at fundamental level, lot of new features gets added.
That's why people who maintains frameworks which are built on top of JS, they roll out updates constantly. Also, Due to very large community of JS, everyday we hear
name of a new framework which creates <b>JavaScript fatigue</b> among the new programmers. So people who are building things and deploying them to production,
they need to be updated all the time.

<br />

Second. Thanks to TypeScript. JS is not static typed. Obviously. This thing definitely creates problem when you write mission-critical software.
With TypeScript, now we can assign the types to variables which solves a major problem.
Companies are using TypeScript to make previously written code type safe.

<br />

No way JS is ideal to write DS & ALGO practice. low levels are critical and you must write them in type safe language. The whole point of learning algorithms is to understand
memory management, time & space management. You must write those things in C++ or at least in Java.

<br />

#### <u>JavaScript for front-end</u>

<br/>

Great. The language itself was written to stay in browser, to run in browser. I heavily used React. Lot of my projects which are currently at production level,
are written in React. I like the community. It helps to solve the problems quickly. In the industry where two giants(google & facebook) open sourced there frameworks, Evan You single handedly worked on his framework: Vue.js.

<br />

I love it. Simple, efficient and Reliable. Lot of big companies, Unicorn
Startups use Vue.js in production - of course for a reason. People love Vue
because it has eco-system. You need not to rely on third party modules. You need
that in React.

<br />

In current time, if you want to build something web-based which is going to be used
by lot of people, a front-end in JS makes thing so easy. It's fast, easy to learn
and easy to deploy. I don't prefer .NET/Java/RubyOnRails. I prefer JS for front-end.

<br />

#### <u>JavaScript for back-end</u>

<br />

Node.js is great for IO operations. It's single threaded non-blocking mechanism works great if your application is heavily data dependent and you are not
working on high computation tasks on server. Node.js is extremely efficient with mongoDB.

Depends. If you want to write back-end for light weight software where you won't receive that much requests with each request doing small complex computations, if you are not building something where end-user
cannot bear the waiting time from server-side. Then you are good to go with JS backend. Use fastify(recommended), express.

<br />

In some cases where it is not okay if user is not getting response in time limit and your backend is doing lot of computations, it is not ideal to user JS back-end. Then what you should use in such case: anything other than JS. May be Java (if you can afford the cost) or Golang. My personal recommendation to write back-ends. Java and Golang are used heavily by many unicorn startups and big tech giants to write critical server-side.

<br />

I personally wrote few thousands lines of server-side JS. It is working
fine till date. But I am pretty much sure that as users grow, I need to re-write
some functions which are called too often.

<br/>

#### <u>JavaScript for App develpoment</u>

<br />

Though React Native is pretty old as compared Flutter, it has many drawbacks.

First. For high-end graphical systems, it is not ideal to develop app in React Native.
The JS bridge definitely makes things slow.

<br />

Second. You need to rely on third party modules. React Native doesn't come up with
standard modules like Flutter.

<br />

If you know React and want to build something light weight - use React Native. My personal
recommendation: Use Flutter. Flutter actually makes things easy. There are lot of
companies out there which burnt out by writing and debugging code in React Native.
They switched to Flutter and now they're happy. It has solid standard library, backed
by Google, much stable as compared to React Native.
