performance improvements on servers:

- minimize requests as much as possible
- compute as min as possible
- cache as much as possible
- reduce no of lines as much as possible
- minimize database connections as much as possible (choose DB wisely. 99% times DB is bottleneck)
- no joins, complex reduce DB operations
- minimize response time (sends minimum data to client)
- do not use external libraries, please.
- done as much processing as you can on client side
