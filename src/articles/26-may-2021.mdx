Since last couple of months, I have been working on my startup. Now, one of the reason why I am writing this article is because I want to keep some personal notes
on which steps we went through while building a MVP which needs to be efficient in every aspect.

<br />

#### <u>Client</u>

<br />

Our client is built in native android (Java). We want to write it in
flutter but our frontend engineer has vast experience in building applications in
Java so it is easy for us to debug errors quickly. That's why we kept Java on client
side.

realistically, we need to adopt flutter as it is cross-platform so we can
reach to maximum users. But we will gradually switch our client stack.

<br />

#### <u>Backend</u>

<br />

All of our performance critical, high throughput services are written in Go. We do not have
received any problems till date.

We first wrote our backend in Node.js with MongoDB. While it was extremely efficient in IO operations,
there are some services which do lot of computations and called by client almost every minute. So it was
not memory efficient. So, We gave up on Node.js.

Later we developed some services in Java (Spring boot), and came to know that it is little bit costly for startup,
as Java needs lot of memory. Plus it was quite verbose and our software team is small. So it was hindering our progress. We gave up on Java.

We needed a language which:
  
  1. is light weight on server side (less memory consumption), memory efficient, memory efficient, have high performance: 
    
    Go is faster than Java on every benchmark. It is extremely fast. It does not rely on virtual machine to compile code, 
    the Go code directly gets converted into binary. Java uses more memory than Go.

- have faster compile time

fast compile time.

- is statically typed (easy to debug errors).
- is memory efficient, have high performance and fast compile time.
- works great with MySQL.

Go was perfect for us. We rewrote all of our services in Go. We moved our database from MongoDB to MySQL. We use
self managed MySQL server.

<br />

#### <u>Admin Panels</u>

<br />

Client side of our admin applications is written in React. It helped us to be productive and fast. Our Admin Panels
are nothing but applications which deals with data gathered by android app users.

All operations are CRUD operations, with
zero computations on client side as well on server side.

<br />

#### <u>What's Next?</u>

<br />

We are going through series of experiences. I'll write every bit of it. I also wanted to write some notes about my experiences.

I look forward to look backward from time to time.
