Since last couple of months, I have been working on my project. Reason why I am writing this post is, I want to keep some personal notes
on steps we went through while building a MVP which needs to be efficient in every aspect.

<br />

We constantly tried a lot of things, especially on server-side and checked whether it
suits our need or not. It is really difficult to choose what to use. Choosing right trade-off is extremely important skill and I have learned it the hard way. Let's begin.

<br />

#### <u>Client</u>

<br />

Our client is built in native android (Java). We want to write it in
flutter but our frontend engineer has vast experience in building applications in
Java so it is easy for us to debug errors quickly. That's why we kept Java on client
side.

realistically, we need to adopt flutter as it is cross-platform so we can
reach to maximum users. But we will gradually switch our client stack.

<br />

#### <u>Backend</u>

<br />

All of our performance critical, high throughput services are written in Go. We have not
received a single problem till date.

We first wrote our backend in Node.js with MongoDB. While it was extremely efficient on IO operations,
there are some services which do lot of computations and called by client almost every minute. So it was
not memory efficient. So, We gave up on Node.js.

Later we developed some services in Java (Spring boot), and came to know that it is little bit costly for startup,
as Java needs lot of memory. Plus it was quite verbose and our software team is small. So it was hindering our progress. We gave up on Java.

We needed a language which:
  
  1. <b>is light weight on server side (less memory consumption, memory efficient and high performance):</b>
     
      Go is faster than Java on every benchmark. It is extremely fast. It does not rely on virtual machine to compile code, 
      the Go code directly gets converted into binary. Java uses more memory than Go. That's the reason while it is used in enterprise and not in 
      small startups.
      
      Talking about memory efficiency, it is garbage collected language like Java but at the same time it has pointers like C++. So you can play with pointers
      without worrying about space management.
    
  2. <b>has faster compile time:</b>
      
      Go has faster compile time than C++. We do not notice it while writing small programs, but when our systems become essentially big it takes lot more               time to compile c++ code. Since your code needs to be compiled before it's run and compiled again after every change you make, compile-time matters for           coding speed.
    
  3. <b>is statically typed:</b>
      
      I have been into JS world for quite a while now. dynamic languages (JavaScript, Python) makes debugging hard. It takes small time to develop softwares               in dynamic languages, but it is really hard to debug the errors. So eventually it becomes hard to maintain the system. Java, C++ and Go are superior at this. 
      Go is greatly type safe with variety of data types.  
  
  4. <b>has great standard library:</b>
    
      In JavaScript world, everything is OSS. Though node.js standard library has few good functions, it does not cover everything a programmer needs on server         side. You have to rely on third party applications. It is difficult when you are running your software on production level where few hundread/thousand             people using it. As soon as anything in that third party library changes, you have to update it in your software and it might break your functionality.     
      
      No doubt Go has great standard library. It has everything you need. It was no brainer for us to choose Go when we found out that we need not rely on third         party modules.
    
  
  5. <b>works great with MySQL:</b>
      
      90% of time, DB is bottleneck. DB drivers are bottleneck. If they are slow, your system is slow. While MongoDB was great, this time we wanted to use
      self managed MySQL server on our own VPS. We needed something like mongoose.js in Go, and that's Go SQL driver. It works like a charm. The type safe structs       in Go language are well suited with MySQL which additionally makes it easy to maintain the application. That's one more reason to choose Go.

<br/>
  
Go seems to be very much underrated to me. It was perfect for us. It is language which was designed by keeping server-side in mind.

<br />

#### <u>Admin Panels and Other Utilities</u>

<br />

Client side of all our web based applications is written in React, mainly because of experience I have in React. It helped us to be productive and fast. 
Also it is easy to roll out client side updates quicky. Our Admin Panels are nothing but applications which deals with data gathered by app users. 

<br />

We intentionally avoid data intensive operations such as pagination, filteration, searching, sorting, etc. on client side simply because:
 - We don't need it. These applications are used by very few people inside organisation. we've strictly kept it as simple to use as possible.
 - It unnecessarily increases cost for the sake of user experience. 

<br />

All operations are straightforward CRUD, with zero computations on client side as well on server side.

<br />

#### <u>What's Next?</u>

<br />

We are going through series of experiences. I'll write every bit of it. I also wanted to write some notes about my experiences.

I look forward to look backward from time to time.
