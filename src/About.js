              Hello üëã Myself Mayur. I'm 23 YO üë®‚Äçüíº, and just completed my
              bachelors degree in Computer Science Engineering. I use Linux üêß
              on my PC üñ•Ô∏è. I'm currently working on my own startup üöÄ. I mostly
              spend my time in learning about computers & programming. I love to
              watch ‚öΩ and I'm huge fan of Liverpool FC üî¥. I'm musician üéº. I
              learned to play harmonium when I was 12 YO & I play piano üéπ too.
              I'm deeply interested in Indian mythology, history üìú, mathematics
              and space üåå.

                Okay. Since you're interested in knowing more about me, you can

                <br />
                Since my childhood, I have been intrigued by a lot of things. I
                was good at studies and consistently scored good grades each
                year. But I was also interested in music, painting, and sports.
                I started learning harmonium at the age of 12. Today, I play
                both piano and harmonium, and sing. I scored 'A' in elementary
                grade examination and 'B' on Intermediate. I was among the top
                scorers in mathematics, when I was in school and Engineering.
                <br />
                <br />
                At the age of 18, I took admission to Engineering and I started
                doing programming. Until then I didn't know what is programming
                and how a computer works. The first language I learned was 'C'
                and it was a terrible experience. Number of errors in my code
                were double that of number of lines in the code. Eventually, I
                learned C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, and Dart(a little
                bit). But I have to admit that my two most favorite programming
                languages are C++ and JavaScript.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since last 3 years, I have been trying my best to understand how
                'structured computer organisation' works. But I like to work on
                software. I develop websites, apps. Hot topics such as data
                science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence
                fascinates me but I have not taken deep dive into them. I hope,
                I'll start learning.
                <br />
                <br />
                Whenever I get free time, I try to read. I'm deeply intrigued by
                areas such as Indian mythology, history, space. I mostly read in
                Marathi and English. I believe that, we can learn most important
                life lessons from Indian mythology. Few books of Amish and Anand
                Neelakantan are in my bucket list. Achyut Godble have written a
                some amazing books. Indian history including some politics
                fascinates me a lot.
                <br />
                <br />
                Football is something I started to love since my college days. I
                love Liverpool FC. This club has given me a lot of beautiful
                memories. Of course, when I get free time, I think about
                football. Nothing can be as special singing 'You will never walk
                alone' before the match. Let's see If I can go to Anfield before
                2024.
                <br />
                <br />
                Next, what do I do, now? I have finished my bachelor of
                engineering degree in computer engineering. I got admit George
                Mason University, California State University. Currently, I am
                working on my own startup company and handling all technical
                stuff. So yes, I'm busy.
